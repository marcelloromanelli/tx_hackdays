TIMDER
========

TIMDER stands for **T**ravelers **I**nterest **M**atching for **D**ebates, **E**xchanges and **R**eviews.

While commuting you are surrounded by strangers starring at their phone while you would actually like to talk to them.
Not just small talk but about topics you can debate about, exchange ideas & knowledge, or hear other opinions.
This application solves this deficiency by matching you with others and defines the topic you should talk about.

Why Do It?
----------

Tamedia and it's companies own a lot of data. From what articles you read, products you buy, when and where you are traveling,
what TV series you are watching, where you lived in the past, ...

We can match travelers by telling you next to which person you should sit and initiate the topic for the talk.
From reviewing yesterdays GNTM and why Sarah has not got a picture, to you grew up in the same neighborhood, to you are
both collecting stamps, to you voted differently in yesterdays poll on 20 minuten about who wins an oscar.

You can also cancel out that we match someone who is commuting in the same train and just do a topic roulette based on
what we know about you and the guy in front of you.

If you don't like the "traveler" stuff then we can also make in more general and replace **T**ravelers by **T**amedia. A trick I learned a few days ago ;-)

By this service we transform useless and boring commuting time (assuming you are not using a Tamedia App or reading a newspaper)
into an entertaining and social valuable adventure.

For us it would be an opportunity to show the unique position Tamedia has with it's reach and rich database and inspire
product development. In addition, it's a cross-company project.

Additional Inputs
------------
Feel free to add your (constructive) input here.


Requirements
------------

Depends on the final scope and whether I find some motivated colleagues for this topic. The more company experts we have
on board and ideas on what kind of discussion potentials we have on those data the better. Ideally we could build an
application that could be integrated into existing apps.

Could use help with...
----------------------

- refining this idea
- inspiration on potential topics we could include based on interactions
- designing & building a frontend / application
