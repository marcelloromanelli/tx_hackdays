Lunchbot
========

There are many excellent and awesome people and Tamedia but how to get them meet each other? Enter Lunchbot... join a Slack channel and Lunchbot finds times for you and other people on the channel to have lunch.

Why Do It?
----------

Because it's a great way to get to know colleages better, helps onboard new employees, build trust in teams and more. In fact there are even a bunch of startups like [RandomLunch](https://www.randomlunch.co) and [lunch-o-mat](http://lunch-o-mat.com) that do it plus [open source projects](https://github.com/search?q=lunch+date).

Requirements
------------

Given Slack and Google Calendar are a normal part of the Tamedia universe, the idea is to use Slack channels as the place for people to "register" themselves (join) to take part then the bot should take care of finding a free space in the calendar for people to have lunch.

Could use help with...
----------------------

- The Google Calendar APIs
- Anyone who's written a Slack-bot before
- Designing a logo for the bot

Links
-----

- https://github.com/iamlordaubrey/lunch_date - a Python slack bot that  - create channel, randomly pairs people. Good starting point for hacking
- https://github.com/Tiege/proj6 - "This program connectes to a prespecified google calendar client and displays the 'busy' times for whichever set of calendars the user chooses." ... Python
