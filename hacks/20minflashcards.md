20min FC
========

Basically we extract text from articles, order the german words by frequency, than create flashcards in this order.
We increase the chances of making good cards by picking sentences with smallest word distance from index word.

Why Do It?
----------

Because flashcards really work.

Requirements
------------

In the beginning some 20min data, a bunch of scripts (ofc) and in the end an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) account.
