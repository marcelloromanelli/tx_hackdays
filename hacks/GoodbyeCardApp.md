GoodbyeCardApp
==============

Challenge
---------

The current process of passing around GoodBye-Cards for leaving colleagues is broken, 
cards get lost and it doesnt scale with a growing organization.
However, due to sentimental reasons, it remains so far in the realm of atoms.
We think it is time to take digitalization serious and move this process into the cloud.

Solution
--------

We want a tool where people can upload hand-written notes for their leaving colleages.
The uploaded pictures are automatically postprocessed and layouted using sophisticated optimization methods to create the perfect design.
This should also take the amount of contributed money into account (payment should clearly be done on a blockchain).
Further tracks are to use Machine Learning methods to identify and distinguish names of contributors and 
to score the submitted messages by originality. Fitting cat-pictures should also be selected.

Benefit
-------

A streamlined process to generate nice-looking GoodBye-Cards. Why only write GoodBye-Cards?
Lets also write Welcome-Cards, or GoToHoliday-Cards. Any reason is good enough to smooth your workplace with sweet talk.

We need...
----------

Developers, developers, developers ... in particular somebody who could do the front-end part, maybe even as a real app and not just a web-dummy.
