HomeRunner
==========

There was once a time when Homegate actually had its own GAME in the AppStore: HomeRunner – A Unity-based runner game that was developed externally, commissioned by Marketing.
After three levels (and ~40k in spent credits), the project was stopped – and the App unfortunately removed from the AppStore…

This hack aims to create a new HomeRunner game that will be embedded in the homegate.ch iOS App as an Easter Egg: A Super Mario-like jump-and-run game to delight our users.

The inspiration for this hack came from the Easter Egg game "CatchTheTrain" hidden in the SBB App – see: [Watson Article](https://www.watson.ch/digital/schweiz/980534238-in-der-sbb-app-verbirgt-sich-ein-geheimes-game-so-kannst-du-es-spielen)

Why Do It?
----------

For some time now we want:
a.) another great Easter Egg in our App
b.) resurrect the HomeRunner game (in a way).

This should add some fun to our App and drive engagement; it even could be used by Marketing for some campaign to increase downloads and generate media buzz for Homegate.

Requirements
------------

- Create basic game using SpriteKit SDK
- Framework Target, so it can be embedded in any iOS (UIKit) or macOS (AppKit) App
- Devise some file format for levels, so we can easily extend the game
- Source will be added to the Homegate GitLab Repository

Could use help with...
----------------------

- SpriteKit SDK – 2D Game Engine (Metal-powered) provided by Apple
- Graphic Assets (player, level elements)
- Level Design
