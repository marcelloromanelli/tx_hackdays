Mentors directory
========

The mentors directory is an app, that will be available to all Tamedia employees. It will be possible to browse a
directory of mentors, filter by topics and book a meeting from available time slots.

Why Do It?
----------
The directory would list mentors, that are keen to teach in particular technologies. On the long run
it is a huge gain for the company. By being a mentor people are able to grow in the topic they will be explaining to their peers,
since teaching someone requires to understand the topic thoroughly.
Mentoring is also an opportunity to exchange on the advanced topic between professionals.
