Branch based translations
=========================

Build a translation tool, which makes Product Owners and Developers happy.

Why Do It?
----------

Until now we had only solutions, that satisfy either the Product Owners or the
Developers. What we are looking for is a tool, which is easy to use for a non techy, but also respects the developer workflows.

Requirements
------------

Code is managed by a version control system.

Could use help with...
----------------------

- Bitbucket API
- Github API
- Gitlab API
