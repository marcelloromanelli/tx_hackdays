WHOIS - slackbot
================

The current search API is really bad. Minimal things to improve are handling first and last name and some fuzzy matching on typos. to make it even more convenient I would like to implement a slackbot as human interface and redirekt results to workday or intranet detail pages.

Why Do It?
----------

If someone is happy with the current search for people - come to me. Otherwise.. still asking?

Goal: Improve search for people:
* First- / Last-Name search is currently broken 
* If you make a typo with complicated names, you will 100% not find the person :(
* Maybe add some meta search functonalities like: whois_bossof XYZ :)

Requirements
------------

* [done] Data from workday
* [done] Informations on the current intranet page: technology, language, hosting, etc
* [done] Better project name :)
* [....] Integration into slack

Could use help with...
----------------------

* someone how maybe knows Workday or have access to people/hierarchie data
* just fun hacking with python and slack...
