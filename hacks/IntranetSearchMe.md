SearchMe
========

The search for people of our intranet is really bad imho. Since the first day at tamedia I'm frustrated by the intranet search for people (only). Having worked 10 years for switzerland's leading phonebook service, it feels like a personal mission to fix this... so.. Time to change this!

Why Do It?
----------

If someone is happy with the current search for people - come to me. Otherwise.. still asking?

Goal: Improve search for people in the intranet:

* First- / Last-Name search is currently broken, fix it
* If you make a typo with complicated names, you will 100% not find the person :(
* Search by department: I want to enter 'TDA' and be able to find all people that belong to this unit
* Search by Kostenstelle 
* ...

Requirements
------------

* Data from workday
* Informations on the current intranet page: technology, language, hosting, etc
* Integration into intranet Web/UI
* Better project name :)

Could use help with...
----------------------

* someone how maybe knows Workday or have access to people/hierarchie data
* intranet web app knowledge
