SearchMe
========

The current search API is really bad. Minimal things to improve are handling first and last name and some fuzzy matching on typos.

Why Do It?
----------

If someone is happy with the current search for people - come to me. Otherwise.. still asking?

Goal: Improve search for people in the intranet:
* First- / Last-Name search is currently broken 
* If you make a typo with complicated names, you will 100% not find the person :(

Requirements
------------

* Data from workday
* Informations on the current intranet page: technology, language, hosting, etc
* Integration into intranet Web/UI
* Better project name :)

Could use help with...
----------------------

* someone how maybe knows Workday or have access to people/hierarchie data
* intranet web app knowledge
