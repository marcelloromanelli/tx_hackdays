FeelGoodDashboard
========

Need a meeting room? 
Dont know what to eat?
Complaining about "bad" air?
Time for shorts or not?
Who's making the biggest noise?

Idea is to collect API and sensor data together and put it on a Tamedia dashboard. Arduino could be used to collect temperature, sound etc. GPS/TripAdvisor API could be used to detect (shuffling) surrounding restaurants with ratings. Robin API could be used for getting the free rooms etc.

Why Do It?
----------

Because we can't do a decision without any information behind:
- Should we eat internally or externally?
- Should I complain about the bad air or is it just me?
- Should we work here or going up to the Presseclub?

Requirements
------------

Working with different APIs and Realtime sensor data. Plattform we could use is Atlas (Python, Redshift, PowerBI).

Could use help with...
----------------------

- HW / Sensors
- Design
- Building the API pipelines
- Parsing intranet for menu (maybe there's an API somewhere!?)
